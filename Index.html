	<title>Better Mother Fucking Website</title>
</head>
<body>
	<h1>This is <em>still</em> a website.</h1>
	<p> And it's even better than the last guy's</p>
	<h2> Seriously, it takes minimal effort to improve this shit.<h2>
	<h3>7 declarations.</h3>
	<p> That's how much CSS it took to turn that <a href="#">grotesque pile of work</a> into this easy-to-read masterpiece. It's so simple and it still has all the glory of the original perfect website: </p>
<ul>
	<li>It's <em>still</em> lightweight and loads fast</li>
	<li><em>Still</em> fits on all your screens</li>
	<li><em>Still</em>looks the same in all your browsers</li>
	<li> It is <em>still</em> accessible to every person that visits your site</li>
	<li>It's <em>still</em> legible and gets your point across></li>
</ul>
<h3>And guess what:</h3>
<P> You never knew it, but it's easy to improve readability on your site> Here's how.</P>
<h2>Let it breathe</h2>
<p>Look at lines 1 and 2 of some shitty website you're building. Assuming they're not married they probably shouldn't be humping. The defaults are trash -- pick a minimum line-height: 1.4 for body copy. Headings should be tighter. If you can't see that...piss off.</p>
<p>If your text hits the side of the browser, fuck off forever. You ever see a book like that? Yes? What a shitty book.</p>
<h2> A little lest contrast</h2>
<p>Black on white? How often do you see that kind of contrast in real life? Tone it down a bit, asshole. I would've even made this site's background a nice #EEEEEE if I wasn't so focused on keeping declarations to a lean 7 fucking lines.</p>
<h2>Line-width, motherfucker</h2>
<p>Looking at an LCD screen is strainful enough. Don't make me read a line of text that's 200 fucking characters long. Keep it to a nice 60-80 and users might actually read more than one sentence of your worthless dribble.</p>
<h2>Yes, this also fucking satire, you fuck</h2>
<p>I love what the creator of <a href="#">this site's inspiration</a> did. What I'm saying is that it's so, so simple to make sites easier to read. Websites are broken by default, they are functional, high-performing, and accessible, but they're also fucking ugly. You and all the other web designers out there need to make them not total shit.</p>
